					Im Amy ... a designer and modern calligrapher in Sherwood Park, Alberta. I love making words look
					beautiful ... on their own, in a quote, or with amazing images. If you need design, calligraphy, or
					hand lettering for your business, special event or for a gift, I can help you get your message just
					right!

					I have always loved words, typography and lettering. I doodled all over my binders in school with
					the typical teenage bubble letters, wrote my name in fancy cursive over and over a million times,
					and felt envious when my brother received a calligraphy set for his birthday (whiche he never used).
					Fast forward a few years and I enrolled in Graphic Design at a community college and studied
					typography, among other art casses. After college, mmost of my experience with beautiful lettering
					was with computer fonts.

					I loved pairing fonts together and using beautiful scrips as ackground images in my graphic design
					work. About five years ago, I stumbled onto an online class about watercolor lettering. I gave it a
					try and I was hooked! I have spent countless hours over the last few years learning to do modern
					calligraphy with a paint brush, brush pen, and pointed dip pen. I think the easiest way to start
					learning calligraphy is with a flexible nib brush pen which is what you will learn in this course.
