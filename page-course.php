            <div class="faq-margin">
                <p>Q: Do I have to have nice handwriting to do calligraphy?</p>
                <p class="answer">A: Aboslutley not! You will learn a sytem of drawing simple basic strokes to create letters. Anyone can
                    do it!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-margin">
                <p>Q: I am left handed. Can I do calligraphy?</p>
                <p class="answer">A: Yes! There are alot of left handed calligraphers. I provide a few tips but it will take some
                    experimenting to find out what will work for you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-margin">
                <p>Q: I was given a calligraphy set as a gift. Can I use that in this course?</p>
                <p class="answer">A: In this course we are doing modern calligraphy with a brush pen, which has a flexible nib that will
                    create thick and thin strokes. Most calligraphy sets that people have conatin a broad edged nib that
                    can be used for certain types of calligraphy such as Italic and Blackletter it will not be used in
                    this course.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-margin">
                <p>Q: What kind of pen do I need for this course?</p>
                <p class="answer">A: The best brush pen to use for this course is the Tombow Fudenosuke which you can find at most art
                    stores. We will use the hard tip pen. (It comes in a soft tip too) If you cannot find this pen, a
                    Pental Sign Brush Pen would work.</p>
                <p class="answer">A: Learning calligraphy is really quite imple. In less than tow hours, I will give you the tools to
                    learn calligraphy and start a creative, mindful practice.</p>
